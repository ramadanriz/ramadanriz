### Hi there <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px">
I'm Rizky Ramadhani, I am a student who lives in <img src="https://image.flaticon.com/icons/svg/197/197594.svg" width="13"/> <b>Jombang, East Java</b>.<br/>
I love making and designing webpages with HTML and CSS (and possible JavaScript in the future). It's fun to code something that anyone on the web can easily see. I love it when I can finally solve a difficult problem.

For my programming projects, I usually only upload to Github once I make significant progress. Feel free to create a pull request to contribute to any of my repositories.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript
- ðŸ”­ I like to code, watch, and play a game in my free time
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he, his, him
